PHP Library is set of classes containing most useful methods and variables for Web Development.

*******************
Release Information
*******************

This repo contains in-development code. Note that there may be some bugs and unfixed code.

*******************
Server Requirements
*******************

PHP version 5.6 or newer is recommended.

It should work on 5.3.7 as well, but I strongly advise you NOT to run
such old versions of PHP, because of potential security and performance
issues, as well as missing features.
