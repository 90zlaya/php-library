# Organisation
Every native class call should have following type of namespace call in front.

```php
// Example of namespace structure
use PHP_Library\Class_Subpackage\Class_Namespace\Class_Name;
```

* All classes are inside src folder.
* All unit tests are inside tests folder.

Autoload file is created by Composer and it's located inside vendor folder.

```php
// How to access PHP Library classes
include_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

# Installation

There are two ways of using PHP Library. First one is to install it inside another project, let's say framework like CodeIgniter. Second one is to install it for development. Either way, you need PHP 7 and Composer to do it.

## Manual

If you want the stable version, get the [latest release] from the releases page.

## Composer

Install stable library version by using standard commands.

```bash
# Install PHP Library via Composer
composer require 90zlaya/php-library
```

## GitHub

If you want to develop this library and use GitHub instead of manual download, just clone repository to your hard drive.

```bash
# Clone repository via Git
git clone https://github.com/90zlaya/php-library.git
```

# Development

## Coding standard

PHP Library has it's own coding standard which deviates from PSR-2 standard with no much exceptions. To contribute to development of this project, you must follow this standard. [PHP_CodeSniffer] does this job for you in development versions of PHP Library.

```bash
# Run coding standard for all PHP files in library
composer run coding-standard
```

If you want to find out more about specific rules, open [ruleset.xml] file which is located in root directory.

## Bug analysis

This library has been tested with [PHP Stan] and approved as bug-free for all classes. It's recommended to run following command to check for buggs in project.

```bash
# Run bug analysis
composer run bug-analysis
```

## Unit testing

All tests are covered with PHPUnit framework and stored inside tests folder. They need outsource folder to perform specific tests, which you have to download and unzip in PHP Library's root directory.

```bash
# Download outsource.zip file
wget https://link.zlatanstajic.com/software/php-library/outsource.zip

# Unzip downloaded file
unzip outsource.zip
```

Command for running unit tests will target [phpunit.xml] file which is located inside root directory.

```bash
# Run PHPUnit tests
composer run phpunit
```

## Automatic tests

You can run all possible automatic tests at once with one simple command.

```bash
# Run all tests
composer run auto-test
```

* Coding standard with PHP_CodeSniffer
* Bug analysis with PHPStan
* Running unit tests with PHPUnit

Precondition for running all tests above is having Composer vendors updated and outsource directory downloaded.
