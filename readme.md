PHP Library
=======

PHP Library is set of custom made PHP classes containing most useful methods and variables for Web Development.
Project is open-sourced under MIT licence on [GitHub]. Available over Composer and [Packagist].

Organisation
=======

Every native class call should have phplibrary namespace call in front.

``` php
phplibrary\Class_Name
```

* All classes are inside src folder.
* All unit tests are inside tests folder.

Autoload file is created by Composer and it's located inside vendor folder.

``` php
include_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

Installation
=======

There are two ways of using PHP Library. First one is to install it inside another project, let's say framework like CodeIgniter. Second one is to install it for development. Either way, you need PHP 7 and Composer to do it.
