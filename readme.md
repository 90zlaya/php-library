PHP Library
=======

PHP Library is set of custom made PHP classes containing most useful methods and variables for Web Development.
Project is open-sourced under MIT licence on [GitHub]. Available over Composer and [Packagist].

Organisation
=======

Autoload file is inside root directory. It contains calls to every class inside php-library. Don't forget to add "../" if you call autoloader from some of the folders. You won't need that call if you're working in root directory.

``` php
include_once 'autoload.php';
```

* All classes are inside /classes folder.
* All demonstrations are inside /demonstrations folder.
* All modules are inside /modules folder and contain subfolders for every module.

Every class call should have phplibrary namespace call in front.

``` php
phplibrary\Class_Name
```
